## Problem Description:
Neighborhood communities in the country face various difficulties in organizing and relating. The lack of mutual knowledge, the difficulty in adapting to the social environment and the absence of spaces for communication make coexistence difficult. These problems, aggravated by social factors due to accelerated changes in society's lifestyle, can be analyzed in detail as follows:
- Lack of efficient communication channels, especially digital.
- Lack of social cohesion and organization between neighbors.
- Lack of effective mechanisms for the resolution of neighborhood conflicts.
- Little inclusion and cases of exclusion of community members.
- Absence of leadership and difficulties in the execution of community initiatives.

As a group we have addressed these points, and through information technologies different methods have been developed to solve these problems. These methods aim to help and possibly solve the aforementioned problems in order to be an advance to improve the quality of life of the communities in the country.

The previously mentioned methods will be explained and addressed with greater complexity in the following chapter of the document: “Solutions”


## Solutions:
In order to work on these problems as a group, we have devised the prototype of the solution which will address all the problems mentioned above.

The proposed solution is a social platform that will improve communication between community members. This platform will be a forum type, where neighbors will be able to present various topics, such as alerts, complaints, constructive criticism, and posts related to the community.

We also present our solution focused on each focus highlighted for this problem:
- **Lack of Group Cohesion:** The platform would have a social section, where neighbors interact and strengthen the sense of community.

- **Poor communication channels:** Our product would have a mechanism in which neighbors can share news and discuss neighborhood projects in an orderly manner.

- **Conflicts between neighbors:** In sync with the solution to the previously mentioned focus, we seek to provide a way to maintain conversations without hindering effective communication.

- **Stigmatized neighbors:** Returning to the social sphere, we aim to facilitate a form of personal expression so that they can make their history and contributions to the community known, promoting empathy.

- **Lack of neighborhood leadership:** Another objective we set is to develop an assessment system that helps identify and support potential leaders, as has been raised in the problem.
