## Problem Description:
Neighborhood communities in the country face various difficulties in organizing and relating. The lack of mutual knowledge, the difficulty in adapting to the social environment and the absence of spaces for communication make coexistence difficult. These problems, aggravated by social factors due to accelerated changes in society's lifestyle, can be analyzed in detail as follows:
- Lack of efficient communication channels, especially digital. (needs to explain why)
- Lack of social cohesion and organization between neighbors. (needs to explain why)
- Lack of effective mechanisms for the resolution of neighborhood conflicts. (needs to explain why) 
- Little inclusion and cases of exclusion of community members. (needs to explain why)
- Absence of leadership and difficulties in the execution of community initiatives. (needs to explain why)

As a group we have addressed these points, and through information technologies different methods have been developed to solve these problems. These methods aim to help and possibly solve the aforementioned problems in order to be an advance to improve the quality of life of the communities in the country.

The previously mentioned methods will be explained and addressed with greater complexity in the following chapter of the document: “Solutions”
